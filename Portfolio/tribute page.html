    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Born on November 10, 1923 in Ōdate, Japan.</li>
     <li>In 1924 Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor at the Tokyo Imperial University took Hachikō as a pet an brought him to live in Shibuya, Tokyo.</li>
     <li>From that point forwards, Ueno would go to work and Hachikō would greet him at the end of the day at the station. </li>
     <li>In May 21, 1925 Ueno did not return. He died during class and never returned to the train station.</li>
     <li>For almost 10 years, Hachikō awaited his return appearing exactly when the train was due at the station.</li>
     <li>One of Ueno students learned the story of Hachikō's life, visited him frequently and published several articles about the dog's impressive loyalty.</li>
     <li>Eventually, Hachikō became a nation-wide symbol of loyalty.</li>
     <li>On March 8, 1935 Hachikō died. His remains were cremated and his ashes buried next to Professor Ueno's.</li>
    </ul>
